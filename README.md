## WORK IN PROGRESS

This started as a sub-project of [another project (MeCHATron)](https://github.com/ndelta0/mechatron) I created to pass my univertisty's programming classes.

This project does not use any external libraries, apart from C++ stdlib and stuff available natively by default (POSIX sockets on Linux, WinSock2 on Windows) and uses C++11 (requirements for the project set by the tutor). Later it may be rewritten to use external libraries, eg. ASIO and *will* ***definetely*** use the latest standard (because why not, being stuck on C++11 is the curse of C++).
